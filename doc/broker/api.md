### Getting Started
-------------------
To view the API description you could use one of the many [installation options](http://swagger.io/docs/#swagger-editor-documentation-0) described.
The easiest way is to use either the [web editor](http://swagger.io/docs/#using-the-editor-on-the-web-2) or to [setup from docker](http://swagger.io/docs/#setup-from-docker-6).

:information_source: Keep in mind that if you're using docker it will start listening on port 80 on your [localhost](http:/localhost:80) by default.
