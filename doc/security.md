Security
--------

## Concepts


### Goals

* Only Resource Providers can submit usage records.
   * Resource Providers can submit usage records only for their resources.
* In case of processing errors, only an authorized user can reprocess usage records that are not yet processed.
* Only authorized users can view usage reports.
   * Authorized users can view only their usage reports.


### Design Constraints

* Follow Cloud Foundry user authentication and authorization model.
* Do not locally store user credentials and their roles.
* Do not ask for user credentials to do the authorization.


### HTTPS

Abacus uses HTTPS as a way to provide secure communication between:
* Resource Providers and Abacus, and
* internally between its pipeline steps/components 


### OAuth

Abacus uses OAuth to authorize:
* Resource Providers usage submission to the pipeline
* Users that want to view usage reports
* Internal pipeline processing steps

OAuth uses access tokens. Abacus works with two types of access tokens: resource and system tokens.


#### Resource tokens

A Resource Provider is expected to present an OAuth token with the usage it submits for a (service or runtime) resource. 

The OAuth token should include:
* a user id uniquely identifying that Resource Provider
* an OAuth scope named like `abacus.usage.<resource_id>.write`
 
A user that wants to get a report for a resource should present a token that has scope named `abacus.usage.<resource_id>.read`.

For example the `linux-container` resource provider should have scope `abacus.usage.linux-container.write` to submit usage.  To get a report an user should present token with the `abacus.usage.linux-container.read` scope to the Abacus reporting component.


#### System token
 
After the submission Abacus 'takes custody' of the submitted data for processing. Abacus pipeline uses its own "system" token to authenticate and authorize the pipeline steps. 

The system token has scopes `abacus.usage.read` and `abacus.usage.write`. 

The Resource Providers can:
* write data in the pipeline via the event collector (providing token with `abacus.usage.<resource_id>.write` scope)
* read data from the pipeline via the reporting (token with `abacus.usage.<resource_id>.read`)

This system token is used to protect the pipeline from unauthorized (erroneous or even malicious) requests, made directly steps of the pipeline, other than the collector and reporting.


#### Token issuer

Abacus can work with Cloud Foundry's UAA or other token issuers, complying with JWT (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) and JWS (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) specifications.
  
The JWT specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-16) only requires HMAC SHA-256 algorithm to be implemented to sign the message (or token), the other algorithms are either recommended or optional. And the JWS specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-10.5) assumes shared key is used - same key to sign and validate the signature.

Token issuer can support both symmetric & asymmetric cryptographic algorithms for token signature and verification. UAA supports both.
 
Symmetric encryption is usually used when all parties are trusted (and can therefore be trusted with the key). In environments where not all parties are trusted, asymmetric encryption should be used.

Abacus requires a specific API to communicate with the Token issuer. This API is implemented in the example Authorization Server distributed with Abacus.  


#### Token validation

The access tokens that are passed in the header serve as both a proof of authentication and authorization (via the scopes).

The validation of the request includes checks for:
* presence of the bearer token
* issuer, signature, expiry, scope

UAA exposes an endpoint called `check_token`, but it's use increases the traffic to UAA, which makes its use in loaded environments undesired.

On the other side the bearer token generated by UAA is a self validating JWT token. Therefore to reduce the load on UAA and increase the processing speed of the pipeline, Abacus validates the token using [jsonwebtoken library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken), with configurable algorithm and secret. The secret can be a password string or a public key in case of asymmetric encryption.  


## Configuration

### Abacus

To run Abacus in secure mode (HTTPS + OAuth tokens) you should modify Abacus application's manifest.yml files.

The set of properties that has to be changed contains:
* SECURED - `true` / `false` - Use `true` to enable the security checks
* AUTHSERVER - Authorization Server URL used to get access token endpoint in the format of `https://hostname:port` or just `https://hostname`.
* CLIENT_ID - Client identifier registered with the specified authorization server.
* CLIENT_SECRET - Client secret used to authenticate the client identifier with the authorization server.
* JWTKEY - Key used to sign the JWT-JWS
* JWTALGO - Cryptographic algorithm used to sign and secure JWT-JWS

You can use CF UAA or an Abacus authorization server as a OAuth token provider. We provide a sample implementation of such server - the Abacus authorization plugin.

### Abacus authorization server
Use the following configuration:
```yml
  SECURED: true
  AUTH_SERVER: abacus-authserver-plugin
  CLIENT_ID: abacus
  CLIENT_SECRET: secret
  JWTKEY: encode
  JWTALGO: HS256
```

**Note:** The Authorization Server is an example implementation, defining the API Abacus uses. You should use it only for testing/development as it is not intended for productive usage.

### CF UAA
Check your UAA configuration or CF deploy manifest on how the JSON Web Token (JWT) is signed. Search for:
* JWT algorithm
* public key (or secret)

Abacus configuration snippet for UAA should look like this:
```yml
    SECURED: true
    AUTH_SERVER: https://api.<CF domain>:443
    CLIENT_ID: abacus
    CLIENT_SECRET: secret
    JWTKEY: |+
      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
      ... <UAA public key> ...
      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    JWTALGO: RS256
```

### Cloud Foundry

The Abacus pipeline consists of several micro-services that run as CF applications. The applications communicate using the externally accessible endpoints, thus no special security settings are needed by default.

To pull monitoring data from all micro-service instances we need to be able to access a specific instance address. Cloud Foundry hides the instances behind a router, so this is not easily achievable. Cloud Foundry's router provides a single hostname for all instances of the same application. For example it cannot provide access to the 4th instance of an application, and instead it loadbalances between all of them.

Abacus uses Netflix's Eureka as a service discovery mechanism to solve the problem. All Abacus applications are registered in Eureka with their IP and port. This plays nice with the rest of Netflix products, such as Turbine, that contacts Eureka to get a list of addresses and use them to aggregate metrics streams. The needed configuration is described in the [monitorig doc](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-abacus/blob/master/doc/monitor.md#cloud-foundry-installation).

To enable monitoring with Eureka and Turbine, an Abacus integrator needs to run Abacus applications into a special security group. This group shall allow direct (app-to-app) communication between Turbine and Abacus applications, so that Turbine can access each microservice instance and fetch data for the individual app instance state. This app-to-app communication is considered a security risk. It is an additional attack vector, since if an attacker gains access to the Abacus pipeline, it can easily reach to all other CF applications.

For development and testing on BOSH-Lite you can use the [all access security group](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-abacus/blob/master/etc/secgroup.json).

An alternative solution to securing CF Abacus system is to use a special cell (placement pool) with a predefined network for the Abacus applications, or to deploy Abacus as distributed system managed by BOSH in its own network.
